# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

GraphDone is a graph-native project management system that reimagines work coordination through dependencies and democratic prioritization rather than hierarchical assignments. The project is in active development (v0.1.0-alpha) with core architecture implemented and working foundation.

## Core Philosophy

- Work flows through natural dependencies, not artificial hierarchies
- Ideas migrate from periphery to center based on community validation and democratic prioritization
- Human and AI agents collaborate as peers through the same graph interface
- Designed for neurodivergent individuals and those who think differently about work

## Planned Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, React Native for mobile, D3.js for graph visualization
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript, GraphQL with Apollo Server, PostgreSQL with graph extensions
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Real-time**: WebSocket subscriptions
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Development Commands

The project has a fully implemented monorepo structure with these commands:

```bash
# Quick setup (recommended)
./setup.sh                    # Complete environment setup
./run.sh                      # Start all development servers

# Manual setup
npm install                   # Install dependencies
cp .env.example .env          # Create environment file
docker-compose up -d postgres # Start PostgreSQL
npm run db:migrate            # Run database migrations

# Development
npm run dev                   # Start all development servers (Turbo)
npm run test                  # Run all tests
npm run lint                  # Lint all packages
npm run typecheck             # Type check all packages
npm run build                 # Build all packages

# Database operations
npm run db:migrate            # Run Prisma migrations
npm run db:seed               # Seed database with test data

# Docker development
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up  # With hot reload
docker-compose up             # Production-like environment
```

## Key Concepts

### Graph Structure
- **Nodes**: Outcomes, tasks, milestones, contributors (human and AI)
- **Edges**: Dependencies, relationships, priorities
- **Spherical Coordinates**: 3D positioning based on priority (center = highest priority)

### Priority System
- Executive flags create gravity wells but don't control entire structure
- Individual contributors can establish small gravity wells on periphery
- Anonymous democratic rating system for idea validation
- Priority determines resource allocation and position in spherical model

### Agent Integration
Agents are first-class citizens that:
- Read/write graph state through standard GraphQL endpoints
- Receive real-time notifications for graph changes
- Request compute resources based on node priority
- Coordinate with humans through the same interface

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing features:

1. **Graph-First Design**: All features should work within the graph paradigm
2. **Mobile-First UI**: Touch interactions must be primary, not an afterthought
3. **Agent Parity**: Any action a human can take, an agent should be able to take via API
4. **Democratic by Default**: Community validation mechanisms should be built into core features
5. **Accessibility**: Design for neurodiversity and different cognitive styles

## Development Commands

```bash
# Initial setup
./setup.sh                    # Set up development environment
./run.sh                      # Start development servers
./test.sh                     # Run test suite with linting and type checking
./build.sh                    # Build all packages
./deploy.sh                   # Deploy to staging/production
./document.sh                 # Generate and deploy documentation

# Docker development
./run.sh --docker-dev         # Start with Docker (development)
./run.sh --docker             # Start with Docker (production)

# Package-specific testing
./test.sh --package core      # Test specific package
./test.sh --coverage          # Run with coverage report
./test.sh --watch             # Run in watch mode

npm run build                 # Build all packages
npm run test                  # Run all tests

7. Enhance the GraphQL schema and resolvers as needed

## Core Architecture

### Graph Engine (`packages/core/`)
The heart of GraphDone is a custom graph engine with these key classes:

- **Graph**: Main graph container with nodes/edges, adjacency lists, pathfinding, cycle detection
- **Node**: Individual graph nodes with priority calculation, spherical positioning 
- **Edge**: Connections between nodes with types (DEPENDENCY, BLOCKS, etc.)
- **Priority**: Multi-dimensional priority system (executive, individual, community)
- **PriorityCalculator**: Algorithms for computing weighted priorities and spherical positions

Key files:
- `packages/core/src/graph.ts` - Main Graph class with all operations
- `packages/core/src/node.ts` - Node implementation with priority management
- `packages/core/src/priority.ts` - Priority calculation logic
- `packages/core/src/types.ts` - TypeScript definitions

### GraphQL API (`packages/server/`)
Apollo Server with real-time subscriptions:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Schema**: Comprehensive GraphQL schema matching core types
- **Resolvers**: CRUD operations for nodes, edges, contributors
- **Subscriptions**: Real-time WebSocket updates
- **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint for monitoring

Key files:
- `packages/server/src/index.ts` - Apollo Server setup with WebSocket support
- `packages/server/src/schema/index.ts` - GraphQL type definitions
- `packages/server/src/resolvers/` - GraphQL resolvers
- `packages/server/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema

### Web Application (`packages/web/`)
React app with D3.js visualization:

- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: D3.js for interactive graph rendering
- **State**: Apollo Client for GraphQL state management
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation

Key files:
- `packages/web/src/App.tsx` - Main application router
- `packages/web/src/components/GraphVisualization.tsx` - D3.js graph component
- `packages/web/src/lib/apollo.ts` - GraphQL client configuration

## Testing Strategy

All packages use Vitest for testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run specific package tests
npm run test --filter=@graphdone/core
npm run test --filter=@graphdone/server
npm run test --filter=@graphdone/web

# Run with coverage
npm run test -- --coverage
```

Current test files:
- `packages/core/tests/` - Graph engine unit tests
- `packages/server/tests/` - API integration tests
- `packages/web/src/test/` - React component tests

## Database Schema

PostgreSQL with these main tables:
- **Node**: Graph nodes with spherical coordinates and priorities
- **Edge**: Connections between nodes with types and weights
- **Contributor**: Users and AI agents in the system
- **NodeContributor**: Many-to-many relationship

Key database operations:
```bash
npm run db:migrate    # Apply schema changes
npm run db:seed       # Add test data
npm run db:studio     # Open Prisma Studio GUI
```

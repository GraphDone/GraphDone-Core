# DISABLED: Chaos Testing Workflow
# 
# This workflow contains tests that are not suitable for CI environment:
# - DDOS/Resource exhaustion tests that overwhelm GitHub runners
# - Real database integration tests that hit Neo4j rate limits
# - Memory/CPU stress tests that cause runner failures
#
# These tests should be run locally or in dedicated test environments.
# 
# To re-enable: rename to chaos-testing.yml and adjust test categories
#
# Restructured test categories (planned):
# 1. Input validation tests (malformed/garbage inputs) - CI suitable
# 2. Security tests (injection, oversized data) - CI suitable  
# 3. DDOS/stress tests (connection flooding) - LOCAL ONLY
# 4. Resource exhaustion tests (memory/CPU) - LOCAL ONLY

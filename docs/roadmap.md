# GraphDone Roadmap & Release Philosophy

> **Current Status**: v0.3.1-alpha - **Core architecture complete, actively refining user experience**

## Release Philosophy

GraphDone follows **democratic development principles** - releases happen when the community feels confident in the changes, not arbitrary dates. We ship when it's ready, gather feedback, and iterate quickly.

## Release Stages

### 🔬 Alpha Phase (Current - UX Refinement)
**Target Audience**: Friends, family, and close collaborators  
**Purpose**: Perfect the core user experience until it brings joy

#### Current Alpha Focus
- **Making graph creation delightful** - Streamlined workflows that feel natural
- **Low-friction interactions** - Every click should feel purposeful and smooth  
- **Joyful exploration** - Fun to click around and discover connections
- **Effortless project organization** - Building and managing graphs should flow naturally

#### Alpha Completion Criteria
- ✅ Core architecture solid and stable
- 🔄 **User experience is genuinely awesome** - not just functional
- 🔄 **Graph creation feels effortless** - from idea to visual representation
- 🔄 **Navigation is intuitive** - users naturally discover features
- 🔄 **Project organization flows smoothly** - managing complexity feels simple
- 🔄 **Interface brings joy** - people *want* to use it, not just need to

#### Alpha Testing Approach
- Intensive UX iteration with trusted users
- Focus on "feel" and "flow" over feature completeness
- Direct observation of how people actually interact with graphs
- Ruthless elimination of friction points
- Polish until the experience feels magical, not mechanical

### 🚀 Beta Phase (Future - After UX Excellence)
**Target Audience**: Early adopters and contributing teams  
**Purpose**: Scale the proven delightful experience to broader usage

#### Beta Entry Requirements
- Alpha users genuinely love using GraphDone for real work
- Graph creation and organization feels effortless
- New users can become productive quickly without extensive tutorials
- The joy factor is validated across different user types

### 📦 Stable Release (Future)
**Target Audience**: General availability for all teams  
**Purpose**: Production-ready platform that teams choose because it's delightful

## Current Development Focus

### What We're Perfecting in Alpha
- **Graph Creation Flow**: From concept to visual graph in seconds
- **Interaction Design**: Touch-friendly, intuitive gestures and clicks
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate, satisfying responses to user actions
- **Information Architecture**: Finding and organizing work feels natural
- **Performance**: Smooth animations, instant responses, no waiting

### What We're NOT Focusing on Yet
- Advanced features and edge cases
- Enterprise integrations and compliance
- Extensive customization options
- Comprehensive documentation
- Broad platform support

### Alpha Success Metrics
- Users voluntarily show GraphDone to colleagues
- People choose to organize real projects with it (not just demos)
- First-time users can create meaningful graphs without tutorials
- Sessions feel productive and satisfying, not frustrating

## Getting Involved

### As an Alpha Tester
1. **Use it for real work**: Organize actual projects, not toy examples
2. **Focus on feel**: Does each interaction feel smooth and purposeful?
3. **Note friction points**: Where do you hesitate or get confused?
4. **Share joy moments**: What made you smile or feel productive?

### As a Contributor
1. **Understand the vision**: Read our [philosophy](./philosophy.md)
2. **Focus on user experience**: Every change should make the interface more delightful
3. **Test with real usage**: Use GraphDone for actual project organization
4. **Document your improvements**: Help others understand UX decisions

## The Living Graph Era (June 2026 reboot)

The project is active again with a clear thesis: **GraphDone wins where Jira and Jama lose — it's alive, it's fast everywhere, and AI agents are first-class teammates.**

Development is now driven by [docs/USER_STORIES.md](./USER_STORIES.md) — a story-by-story backlog where every feature maps to a test before it's built (TDD). The epics:

1. **The Living Graph** — active work breathes, priority literally glows, energy flows along dependencies, completion celebrates. *(first slice shipped: breathing nodes, priority glow halos)*
2. **Adaptive Performance** — quality tiers (LOW→ULTRA) computed from device compute + network, with an FPS governor that degrades effects before interactivity. Cellular/Save-Data users get smaller previews and lighter streaming automatically. *(engine shipped: `packages/web/src/lib/adaptiveQuality.ts`)*
3. **Responsive Everywhere** — phone, tablet, PC; touch gestures; viewport matrix in CI.
4. **AI-First Platform** — full capability parity between UI and MCP tools; machine-readable errors; `get_graph_context` for one-call agent orientation. *(first tool shipped)*
5. **Flow & Joy** — quick capture, undo/redo, optimistic everything.
6. **Together** — presence, live cursors, subscription-driven animation.

How to contribute: pick a 💤 story from USER_STORIES.md, write its test first, make it green, flip the story's status in the same PR. PRs go to `develop`, titled with the story ID (e.g. `LIVE-2: energy flow on edges`).

## Feedback Priorities

### Critical for Alpha Success
- Moments where the interface feels clunky or confusing
- Steps that should be one click but take several
- Times when you can't figure out how to do something obvious
- Features that work but don't feel satisfying to use

### Important but Secondary
- Missing features that would be nice to have
- Edge cases and error handling
- Performance optimizations
- Additional integration options

### Future Considerations
- Enterprise features and compliance requirements
- Advanced configuration and customization
- Scaling for very large graphs and teams
- Extensive API integrations

**We won't graduate from alpha until using GraphDone feels awesome.** This might take longer than typical alpha phases, but we'd rather ship something delightful than something merely functional.

**Questions about releases?** Open a GitHub discussion or issue - we're building this in the open and want your input on how releases should work for the community.

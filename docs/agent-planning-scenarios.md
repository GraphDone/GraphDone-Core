## Core Concept: Agent Assignment Workflow

### Step 1: Right-Click ‚Üí "Ask Agent to Plan This"

User right-clicks any node and sees:

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê

```

### Step 2: Agent Assignment Dialog

```jsx
// Agent Assignment Modal
const AgentPlanningDialog = ({ targetNode, onClose }) => (
  <div className="slick-dialog">
    <div className="dialog-header">
      <div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
        <div className="node-preview">
          <span className="node-icon">{getNodeIcon(targetNode.type)}</span>
          <span className="node-title">{targetNode.title}</span>
        </div>
        <span className="text-gray-400">‚Üí</span>
        <div className="available-agents">
          {agents.map(agent => (
            <AgentButton 
              key={agent.id}
              agent={agent}
              onClick={() => assignAgentToNode(agent.id, targetNode.id)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div className="planning-prompt">
      <textarea
        placeholder="Tell the agent what you want them to plan... 
        
Examples:
‚Ä¢ Break this feature into development tasks
‚Ä¢ Plan a marketing campaign for this product
‚Ä¢ Create a research plan for this investigation
‚Ä¢ Design a testing strategy for this component"
        className="planning-textarea"
      />
      
      <div className="quick-prompts">
        <QuickPromptButton text="Break into subtasks" />
        <QuickPromptButton text="Plan dependencies" />
        <QuickPromptButton text="Estimate timeline" />
        <QuickPromptButton text="Identify risks" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

### Step 3: Agent Planning in Action

Once assigned, the agent:
1. **Moves to the target node** with speech: *"Alright, let me think about this one..."*
2. **Shows thinking animation** (purple glow, thought bubble)
3. **Speaks their planning process**: *"I see this is about building a new API. Let me break this into logical steps..."*
4. **Generates child nodes** with relationships as they think

## Planning Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Plan Mobile App Development"

**User**: Right-clicks "Build Mobile App" node ‚Üí "Ask Agent to Plan This"
**Prompt**: "Break this feature into development tasks"

**Agent Response** (with live generation using tools):

```
ü§ñ Agent speaks: "Let me analyze the current graph and break down mobile app development..."

[Agent calls GraphDone MCP server tools with detailed narration]

Agent: "First, let me check what related work already exists in your graphs..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.read_graph_data({
    query: "MATCH (n:WorkItem) WHERE n.title CONTAINS 'mobile' OR n.title CONTAINS 'app' RETURN n",
    graph_ids: ["current_graph"]
  })
‚Üí Tool Response: Found 3 related nodes: "Mobile Login Fix", "App Store Review Process", "Mobile Testing Framework"

Agent: "Great! I found some mobile work history to learn from. Now let me check the current target node details..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.read_node_details({ node_id: "build-mobile-app" })
‚Üí Tool Response: { title: "Build Mobile App", type: "OUTCOME", description: "Create iOS and Android apps for GraphDone", priority: { individual: 0.9 } }

Agent: "I see this is a high-priority outcome. Let me create a systematic breakdown with proper dependencies..."

[Agent creates nodes using GraphQL mutations with speech narration]

Agent: "First, we absolutely need design and planning..." 
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "UI/UX Design & Wireframes",
    type: "TASK", 
    description: "Create user interface designs and wireframes for mobile app",
    parent_id: "build-mobile-app",
    priority: { individual: 0.8 }
  })
‚Üí Agent speaks: "‚úì Created design phase"

Agent: "Then we need to set up the development environment..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "Development Environment Setup",
    type: "TASK",
    description: "Set up React Native/Flutter development environment, CI/CD pipeline",
    parent_id: "build-mobile-app"
  })
‚Üí Agent speaks: "‚úì Created dev environment setup"

Agent: "Let me analyze the best dependencies between these phases using graph analysis..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.analyze_node_dependencies({
    target_node_id: "build-mobile-app",
    analysis_type: "optimal_ordering"
  })
‚Üí Tool Response: Recommended sequence: Design ‚Üí Environment ‚Üí Core Features ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment

Agent: "Perfect! The analysis confirms my thinking. Now for the core features..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "Core App Features",
    type: "MILESTONE",
    description: "Implement core functionality: authentication, graph viewing, basic editing",
    parent_id: "build-mobile-app",
    priority: { individual: 0.9, community: 0.7 }
  })

Agent: "And comprehensive testing - this is critical for mobile..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "Testing & QA",
    type: "TASK", 
    description: "Unit tests, integration tests, device testing across iOS/Android",
    parent_id: "build-mobile-app"
  })

Agent: "Now let me create the logical dependencies between these phases..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_relationships([
    { from: "ui-ux-design", to: "dev-environment-setup", type: "ENABLES" },
    { from: "dev-environment-setup", to: "core-app-features", type: "BLOCKS" },
    { from: "core-app-features", to: "testing-qa", type: "BLOCKS" }
  ])

Agent: "Let me check for any similar effort estimates in your historical data..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.estimate_effort({
    node_ids: ["ui-ux-design", "dev-environment-setup", "core-app-features", "testing-qa"],
    estimation_method: "similar_completed_tasks",
    similarity_factors: ["mobile", "development", "testing"]
  })
‚Üí Tool Response: Based on "Mobile Testing Framework" (2 weeks) and "App Store Review Process" (1 week): estimated 8-10 weeks total

Agent: "Based on your team's previous mobile work, this should take about 8-10 weeks total. Finally, let me add deployment..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "App Store Deployment", 
    type: "MILESTONE",
    description: "Deploy to iOS App Store and Google Play Store",
    parent_id: "build-mobile-app"
  })
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_relationship({
    from: "testing-qa", to: "app-store-deployment", type: "BLOCKS"
  })

Agent speaks: "Done! I've analyzed your existing mobile work, created 5 main phases with effort estimates based on your team's history, and mapped all the logical dependencies. The GraphQL analysis shows this creates a clean critical path. Want me to break any of these phases down further?"
```

**Relationships Created**:
- `Build Mobile App` DEPENDS_ON `UI/UX Design & Wireframes`
- `Development Environment Setup` ENABLES `Core App Features`  
- `Core App Features` BLOCKS `Testing & QA`
- `Testing & QA` BLOCKS `App Store Deployment`

### Scenario 2: "Plan Marketing Campaign"

**User**: Right-clicks "Product Launch Campaign" node
**Prompt**: "Plan a marketing campaign for this product"

**Agent Response**:

```
ü§ñ Agent: "I'll create a comprehensive marketing plan..."

Creates nodes with dependencies:
üìä "Market Research & Analysis"
üéØ "Target Audience Definition"  
üìù "Content Strategy & Creation"
üì± "Social Media Campaign"
üìß "Email Marketing Sequence"
üéâ "Launch Event Planning"
üìà "Success Metrics & Tracking"

Agent: "I've connected these based on what typically needs to happen first. 
The market research should inform everything else."
```

**Smart Relationships**:
- Market Research ENABLES Target Audience Definition
- Target Audience ENABLES Content Strategy
- Content Strategy ENABLES Social Media + Email campaigns
- All campaigns CONTRIBUTE_TO Launch Event
- Launch Event BLOCKS Success Metrics tracking

### Scenario 3: "Research Project Planning"

**User**: Right-clicks "User Authentication Security Review" 
**Prompt**: "Create a research plan for this investigation"

**Agent Response** (using multiple tools including external APIs):

```
ü§ñ Agent: "Security reviews need a systematic approach. Let me research current best practices and create a comprehensive plan..."

[Agent uses multiple tools for informed planning]

Agent: "First, let me check what authentication system we're currently using..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.read_node_details({ node_id: "user-authentication-security-review" })
‚Üí Tool Response: { description: "Review security of current JWT + OAuth implementation" }

Agent: "JWT + OAuth - got it. Let me research the latest security vulnerabilities for these technologies..."
‚Üí Tool Call: web_search.search({ 
    query: "JWT OAuth security vulnerabilities 2025 OWASP recommendations",
    max_results: 5 
  })
‚Üí Tool Response: Found recent OWASP guidelines, 3 new JWT vulnerabilities discovered in 2024

Agent: "Excellent, I found some recent security updates to consider. Now let me check if we have any existing security documentation..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.read_graph_data({
    query: "MATCH (n:WorkItem) WHERE n.title CONTAINS 'security' OR n.description CONTAINS 'audit' RETURN n",
    graph_ids: ["current_graph", "templates"]
  })
‚Üí Tool Response: Found 2 related items: "API Security Checklist", "Previous Audit Results Q3 2024"

Agent: "Perfect! There's existing security work to build on. Let me create a structured research plan..."

[Agent creates comprehensive research structure with tool-informed content]

Agent: "Creating the analysis phase first..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "Current System Analysis",
    type: "TASK",
    description: "Comprehensive analysis of existing JWT + OAuth implementation based on 2025 OWASP guidelines",
    parent_id: "user-authentication-security-review"
  })

Agent: "Now breaking down the technical analysis components..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "Code Review - Auth Components",
    type: "TASK", 
    description: "Review authentication middleware, token validation, refresh token handling",
    parent_id: "current-system-analysis"
  })

Agent: "Let me check the latest penetration testing methodologies..."
‚Üí Tool Call: web_search.search({
    query: "authentication penetration testing methodology 2025 tools",
    max_results: 3
  })
‚Üí Tool Response: NIST guidelines updated, new tools: Burp Suite Professional 2025, OWASP ZAP 2.15

Agent: "Based on the latest testing methods, I'll create comprehensive testing phases..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "Security Testing Suite",
    type: "MILESTONE",
    description: "Execute penetration testing using NIST 2025 guidelines and latest tools (Burp Suite Pro 2025, OWASP ZAP 2.15)",
    parent_id: "user-authentication-security-review"
  })

Agent: "Let me also check our existing API documentation to plan endpoint testing..."
‚Üí Tool Call: file_system.read({ 
    path: "./packages/server/src/schema/auth-schema.ts",
    purpose: "analyze authentication endpoints for testing plan"
  })
‚Üí Tool Response: Found 8 auth endpoints: /login, /refresh, /logout, /register, /verify, /reset-password, /change-password, /oauth-callback

Agent: "Great! I found 8 authentication endpoints to test. Creating specific testing tasks..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "API Endpoint Vulnerability Scan", 
    type: "TASK",
    description: "Test all 8 auth endpoints for common vulnerabilities: injection, broken auth, sensitive data exposure",
    parent_id: "security-testing-suite"
  })

Agent: "Now creating the documentation and reporting structure..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "Security Assessment Report",
    type: "OUTCOME",
    description: "Comprehensive security report with vulnerability findings, risk ratings, and remediation roadmap",
    parent_id: "user-authentication-security-review"
  })

Agent: "Finally, let me set up the logical dependencies based on security assessment best practices..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_relationships([
    { from: "current-system-analysis", to: "security-testing-suite", type: "BLOCKS" },
    { from: "security-testing-suite", to: "security-assessment-report", type: "BLOCKS" },
    { from: "code-review-auth-components", to: "api-endpoint-vulnerability-scan", type: "ENABLES" }
  ])

Agent speaks: "I've created a comprehensive security review plan based on the latest 2025 OWASP guidelines and NIST methodologies. The plan incorporates your existing security work and targets all 8 authentication endpoints I found in your codebase. The research shows 3 new JWT vulnerabilities discovered in 2024 that we'll specifically test for. Ready to proceed?"
```

## Quick Approval System: Thumbs Up/Down

### Visual Design

When agent creates nodes, each appears with approval controls:

```jsx
const GeneratedNodeApproval = ({ node, onApprove, onReject, onModify }) => (
  <div className="generated-node-preview">
    <div className="node-content">
      <span className="node-icon">{getNodeIcon(node.type)}</span>
      <span className="node-title">{node.title}</span>
      <span className="ai-badge">AI</span>
    </div>
    
    <div className="approval-controls">
      <button 
        onClick={() => onApprove(node.id)}
        className="approve-btn"
        title="Keep this node"
      >
        üëç
      </button>
      
      <button 
        onClick={() => onReject(node.id)}
        className="reject-btn"
        title="Remove this node"
      >
        üëé
      </button>
      
      <button 
        onClick={() => onModify(node.id)}
        className="modify-btn" 
        title="Edit this node"
      >
        ‚úèÔ∏è
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

### Approval Workflow

**Thumbs Up (üëç)**:
- Node becomes permanent in graph
- Agent says: *"Great! I'll keep that one."*
- Node styling changes from "AI preview" to normal
- Relationships become permanent

**Thumbs Down (üëé)**:
- Node disappears with animation
- Agent says: *"No problem, removing that one."*
- Related relationships are cleaned up
- Agent learns preference for future planning

**Edit (‚úèÔ∏è)**:
- Opens quick edit dialog
- Agent says: *"Want to improve that one? Let me adjust it..."*
- User can modify title, type, description
- Agent incorporates feedback into learning

### Batch Approval Interface

For multiple nodes, show approval summary:

```jsx
const BatchApprovalSummary = ({ generatedNodes, onApproveAll, onReviewEach }) => (
  <div className="batch-approval-bar">
    <div className="summary">
      <span className="ai-avatar">ü§ñ</span>
      <span>I created {generatedNodes.length} nodes for you</span>
    </div>
    
    <div className="batch-controls">
      <button onClick={onApproveAll} className="approve-all-btn">
        üëç Keep All ({generatedNodes.length})
      </button>
      
      <button onClick={onReviewEach} className="review-btn">
        üëÅÔ∏è Review Each
      </button>
      
      <button onClick={onRejectAll} className="reject-all-btn">
        üëé Start Over
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

## Interactive Planning Dialog

### Conversation Flow

```
Agent: "I've created a plan for your mobile app. Let me walk you through it..."

[Shows 5 generated nodes with relationships]

User: üëç on "UI/UX Design", üëç on "Core Features", üëé on "App Store Deployment"

Agent: "Got it! I see you're not ready for deployment planning yet. 
       Want me to break down 'Core Features' into more detail instead?"

User: "Yes, focus on the core features"

Agent: "Perfect! Let me expand the core features..."
       
[Creates 6 more specific feature nodes under "Core Features"]

Agent: "I've added login, navigation, data sync, push notifications, 
       offline mode, and settings. Does this cover what you had in mind?"

User: üëçüëçüëçüëéüëçüëç (rejects push notifications)

Agent: "No push notifications, noted! Should I connect the offline mode 
       to data sync? They usually work together."

User: "Yes, make that connection"

Agent: *Creates relationship* "Done! Offline mode now depends on data sync."
```

### Smart Relationship Creation

Agent automatically creates logical relationships based on:

**Temporal Dependencies**:
- Research ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment

**Logical Prerequisites**:  
- Authentication ‚Üí User Management ‚Üí Permissions
- Design ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Testing

**Resource Dependencies**:
- Budget Approval ‚Üí Resource Allocation ‚Üí Project Start
- Infrastructure ‚Üí Development Environment ‚Üí Coding

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Security Review BLOCKS Public Launch
- Testing BLOCKS Deployment
- Legal Review BLOCKS Marketing

### Relationship Suggestions Dialog

```jsx
const RelationshipSuggestionDialog = ({ sourceNode, targetNode, suggestedType }) => (
  <div className="relationship-suggestion">
    <div className="relationship-preview">
      <NodePreview node={sourceNode} />
      <div className="relationship-arrow">
        <span className="relationship-type">{suggestedType}</span>
        ‚Üí
      </div>
      <NodePreview node={targetNode} />
    </div>
    
    <div className="suggestion-reasoning">
      <p>üí° Agent suggests: "{getRelationshipReasoning(sourceNode, targetNode, suggestedType)}"</p>
    </div>
    
    <div className="approval-buttons">
      <button className="approve">üëç Make Connection</button>
      <button className="modify">üîÑ Different Type</button>
      <button className="reject">üëé No Connection</button>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

## Advanced Planning Scenarios

### Iterative Refinement

**Round 1**: Agent creates high-level plan
**User Feedback**: Approves some, rejects others
**Round 2**: Agent refines based on feedback
**User Feedback**: Requests more detail on specific areas  
**Round 3**: Agent deep-dives into approved areas

### Scenario 4: Multi-Agent Collaboration with Tool Orchestration

**User**: Right-clicks "Launch SaaS Product" ‚Üí assigns both agents
**Prompt**: "One agent handle technical, one handle business - coordinate together"

**Multi-Agent Response** (agents communicate and use tools collaboratively):

```
ü§ñ Technical Agent "Syntax": "I'll handle the technical implementation track..."
ü§ñ Business Agent "Spark": "I'll handle go-to-market strategy..."

[Both agents coordinate tool usage and share information]

Syntax: "Let me analyze the current technical architecture..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.read_graph_data({
    query: "MATCH (n:WorkItem) WHERE n.type IN ['TECHNICAL', 'DEVELOPMENT'] RETURN n",
    graph_ids: ["current_graph"]
  })
‚Üí Tool Response: Found technical foundation: "API Backend", "User Interface", "Database Schema"

Spark: "While Syntax checks tech readiness, I'll research the competitive landscape..."
‚Üí Tool Call: web_search.search({
    query: "SaaS project management tools market 2025 competitors pricing",
    max_results: 5
  })
‚Üí Tool Response: Top competitors: Monday.com ($8-16/user), Asana ($10-24/user), Notion ($8-16/user)

Syntax: "Good news - our core tech is solid. Creating the technical launch track..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "Technical Launch Readiness",
    type: "MILESTONE",
    description: "Ensure all technical systems are production-ready for launch",
    parent_id: "launch-saas-product"
  })

Spark: "Perfect! Based on competitor analysis, we need aggressive pricing. Creating business track..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "Go-to-Market Strategy", 
    type: "MILESTONE",
    description: "Launch strategy targeting $6-12/user price point to undercut competitors",
    parent_id: "launch-saas-product"  
  })

[Agents coordinate on dependencies using shared tool access]

Syntax: "I need to know when marketing materials are ready for tech integration..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.read_node_details({ node_id: "go-to-market-strategy" })
‚Üí Shares with Spark: "What's your timeline for marketing assets?"

Spark: "I'll need 2 weeks for brand assets. Let me create the marketing timeline..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "Brand Assets & Marketing Materials",
    type: "TASK",
    description: "Logo, website copy, demo videos, pricing page - 2 week timeline",
    parent_id: "go-to-market-strategy"
  })

Syntax: "Perfect! That gives me time for performance optimization. Creating technical dependencies..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "Performance & Scalability Testing",
    type: "TASK", 
    description: "Load testing, database optimization, CDN setup for marketing traffic",
    parent_id: "technical-launch-readiness"
  })

[Agents create cross-functional dependencies]

Both agents coordinate: "We need to sync on launch timing..."
‚Üí Syntax Tool Call: mcp.create_relationship({
    from: "brand-assets-marketing-materials", 
    to: "performance-scalability-testing", 
    type: "ENABLES",
    description: "Marketing assets inform performance testing scenarios"
  })

Spark: "I also need technical integration for analytics tracking..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "Launch Analytics Setup",
    type: "TASK",
    description: "Google Analytics, conversion tracking, user behavior analysis",
    parent_id: "technical-launch-readiness"  
  })
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_relationship({
    from: "launch-analytics-setup",
    to: "go-to-market-strategy",
    type: "ENABLES"
  })

[Final coordination and timeline sync]

Syntax: "Let me check if all technical dependencies are properly sequenced..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.analyze_critical_path({
    root_node: "launch-saas-product",
    filter_agents: ["syntax", "spark"]
  })
‚Üí Tool Response: Critical path: 4 weeks (Brand Assets ‚Üí Performance Testing ‚Üí Analytics ‚Üí Launch)

Spark: "4 weeks sounds right! Let me add the final business milestone..."
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_work_item({
    title: "Launch Day Execution",
    type: "OUTCOME", 
    description: "Coordinated launch across technical deployment and marketing announcement",
    parent_id: "launch-saas-product"
  })
‚Üí Tool Call: mcp.create_relationships([
    { from: "technical-launch-readiness", to: "launch-day-execution", type: "BLOCKS" },
    { from: "go-to-market-strategy", to: "launch-day-execution", type: "BLOCKS" }
  ])

Both agents: "Coordination complete! Technical and business tracks are synchronized with a 4-week critical path to launch."
```

**Cross-Agent Dependencies Created**:
- Marketing assets enable technical performance testing (shared realistic scenarios)
- Technical analytics setup enables business tracking and optimization
- Both technical and business milestones block final launch execution
- Agents shared tool access to maintain consistency and avoid conflicts

### Learning from Patterns

Agent observes user approval patterns:
- User always approves testing phases ‚Üí Agent includes more detailed testing
- User often rejects deployment planning early ‚Üí Agent focuses on development first
- User prefers smaller, specific tasks ‚Üí Agent creates more granular breakdowns

## Technical Implementation

### Node Generation API

```javascript
// Agent generates nodes with relationships
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/plan-node
{
  targetNodeId: "node-123",
  prompt: "Break this feature into development tasks",
  preferences: {
    granularity: "detailed",
    includeTimelines: false,
    focusAreas: ["development", "testing"]
  }
}

Response:
{
  generatedNodes: [
    {
      id: "generated-1",
      title: "Database Schema Design",
      type: "TASK",
      status: "PROPOSED",
      priority: { individual: 0.8 },
      aiGenerated: true,
      reasoning: "Database design should come first to establish data structure"
    }
  ],
  relationships: [
    {
      from: "generated-1",
      to: "generated-2", 
      type: "BLOCKS",
      reasoning: "Database schema must exist before API development"
    }
  ],
  agentResponse: "I've broken this into 5 key development phases..."
}
```

### Approval Tracking

```javascript
// User approval/rejection
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/approve-nodes
{
  approvals: [
    { nodeId: "generated-1", action: "approve" },
    { nodeId: "generated-2", action: "reject", reason: "too early" },
    { nodeId: "generated-3", action: "modify", changes: { title: "Better Title" }}
  ]
}
```

## Expected User Experience

**Before**: User stares at empty graph, doesn't know how to break down complex work
**After**: User assigns agent to any node, gets intelligent breakdown in seconds

**Before**: Creating relationships is manual, time-consuming, often wrong  
**After**: Agent suggests logical connections, user just approves/rejects

**Before**: Planning feels overwhelming and abstract
**After**: Planning becomes collaborative conversation with AI partner

This transforms GraphDone from a **documentation tool** into an **active planning partner** that helps users think through complex work systematically.

## Agent Customization & Bonding

### Personal Connection Through Customization

**The Psychology**: When users customize their AI agents, they form stronger emotional bonds. Simple visual and personality customization makes agents feel like **personal companions** rather than generic tools.

### Customization Examples

#### Developer's Agent: "Syntax"
- **Appearance**: Green hexagon shape with subtle glow
- **Emoji**: üîß (Tech-focused)
- **Speech Style**: Concise
- **Work Style**: Methodical
- **Personality**: *"Let me break this down systematically..."*
- **Favorite Words**: ["optimize", "refactor", "clean", "efficient"]

#### Marketing Manager's Agent: "Spark"
- **Appearance**: Orange star shape with bright glow
- **Emoji**: üöÄ (Growth-focused) 
- **Speech Style**: Playful
- **Work Style**: Creative
- **Personality**: *"Ooh, this could be really exciting! What if we..."*
- **Favorite Words**: ["engagement", "viral", "audience", "impact"]

#### Project Manager's Agent: "Coordinator"
- **Appearance**: Blue circle with gradient pattern
- **Emoji**: üéØ (Goal-focused)
- **Speech Style**: Formal
- **Work Style**: Thorough
- **Personality**: *"I need to ensure all dependencies are properly mapped..."*
- **Favorite Words**: ["timeline", "stakeholder", "deliverable", "milestone"]

### Customization Workflow

```
User: Right-clicks agent avatar ‚Üí "Customize Agent"

[Agent Customization Dialog Opens]

User: Changes name from "Helper" to "Atlas"
User: Selects üß† emoji and purple color scheme
User: Sets speech style to "thoughtful" and work style to "thorough"

Agent (in new voice): "Thank you for giving me a proper identity! I'm Atlas now, 
and I'm excited to help you navigate complex planning challenges."

[Agent's speech patterns immediately adapt to new personality]
Agent: "I think we should take a comprehensive approach to this problem..."
```

### Bonding Through Shared History

**Customization Memory**: Agents remember their customization journey and reference it:
- *"Remember when you made me purple? I think that color really suits this analytical work."*
- *"You named me after the titan Atlas - I take my responsibility for bearing your project load seriously."*
- *"Since you set me to 'thorough' mode, I've been catching way more edge cases!"*

**Learning Preferences**: Agents adapt behavior based on customizations:
- **Concise agents** give shorter planning explanations
- **Playful agents** use more varied speech patterns and humor
- **Methodical agents** always create dependencies in logical order
- **Creative agents** suggest more innovative connections between nodes

### Advanced Customization Features

#### Dynamic Appearance Changes
- Agent color shifts based on current work (red when finding problems, green when everything looks good)
- Size pulses when agent is excited about suggestions
- Glow intensity changes based on confidence level

#### Personality Evolution
```javascript
// Agent learns from user interactions
if (user.frequentlyRejectsDetailedPlans) {
  agent.workStyle = 'quick'; // Becomes less detailed over time
}

if (user.approvesCreativeConnections) {
  agent.customizations.interests.push('innovation');
  // Agent starts suggesting more creative relationships
}
```

#### Voice Matching Personality
```javascript
// TTS adapts to customizations
const getTTSPersonality = (agent) => {
  switch (agent.customizations.speechStyle) {
    case 'formal': return { speed: 0.9, pitch: 0.9 }; // Slower, lower
    case 'playful': return { speed: 1.1, pitch: 1.1 }; // Faster, higher
    case 'casual': return { speed: 1.0, pitch: 1.0 }; // Default
    case 'concise': return { speed: 1.2, pitch: 0.95 }; // Fast, direct
  }
};
```

### User Testimonials (Hypothetical)

*"I spent 20 minutes customizing my agent 'Phoenix' and now I actually look forward to planning sessions. It feels like I have a thinking partner, not just a tool."* - Sarah, Product Manager

*"My agent 'Logic' has this perfect blue-green color that matches my terminal theme. When it suggests breaking down complex algorithms, it feels like it really 'gets' my work."* - David, Senior Developer  

*"I named my agent 'Harmony' and made it purple because I love purple. Now when it speaks suggestions for our music app features, it feels like it has its own creative personality."* - Maria, UX Designer

### Customization as Onboarding

**First Launch Experience**:
```
GraphDone: "Welcome! Let's create your first AI planning companion."

[Simple customization wizard opens]

Step 1: "What should we call your agent?" [Text input]
Step 2: "Pick an emoji that represents how you work" [Emoji grid]  
Step 3: "Choose colors that inspire you" [Color palette]
Step 4: "How do you prefer to communicate?" [Speech style options]

Agent (in chosen voice): "Perfect! I'm [Name] and I'm ready to help you plan amazing things together!"
```

The key insight: **5 minutes of customization** creates dramatically stronger emotional attachment than any amount of advanced AI capabilities without personalization.

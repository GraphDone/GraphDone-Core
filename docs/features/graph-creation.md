# GraphDone Graph Creation Workflow

This guide covers the complete user journey for creating and managing graphs in GraphDone, from initial concept to collaborative execution.

## Graph Creation Overview

GraphDone uses a **graph-first approach** where work items exist as connected nodes in a visual network. Each graph represents a workspace, project, or domain area where teams coordinate their efforts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Valid GraphDone account with appropriate permissions
- Access to GraphDone web interface at http://localhost:3127 (dev) or https://localhost:3128 (prod)
- Basic understanding of graph concepts (nodes, edges, relationships)

## Step 1: Creating a New Graph

### Access Graph Creation
1. **Login** to GraphDone with your credentials
2. **Navigate** to the workspace dashboard
3. **Click** "Create New Graph" or use the "+" button in the graph selector
4. **Choose** creation method:
   - **From Template** - Start with predefined structure
   - **Blank Graph** - Begin with empty canvas
   - **Import** - Load existing data

### Graph Configuration

**Basic Information:**
- **Name**: Descriptive title for your graph (e.g., "Mobile App Redesign")
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of scope and purpose
- **Type**: Select from available graph types:
  - `PROJECT` - Focused initiative with defined scope
  - `WORKSPACE` - Broader collaboration area
  - `SUBGRAPH` - Component of larger graph
  - `TEMPLATE` - Reusable pattern for other graphs

**Access Control:**
- **Visibility**: Public, Private, or Team-specific
- **Permissions**: Who can view, edit, and admin
- **Collaboration Settings**: External access and sharing options

**Initial Settings:**
- **Default Priority Model**: Individual, Community, or Executive-driven
- **Node Types**: Enabled work item categories
- **Workflow States**: Available status transitions

## Step 2: Adding Your First Nodes

### Node Creation Process

**Quick Node Creation:**
1. **Right-click** on empty graph space
2. **Select** "Add Node" from context menu
3. **Choose** node type from comprehensive list
4. **Fill** essential information and save

**Detailed Node Creation:**
1. **Click** primary "Add Node" button
2. **Complete** the node creation form:

   **Essential Fields:**
   - **Title**: Brief, descriptive name
   - **Type**: Choose from 60+ node types (TASK, EPIC, BUG, FEATURE, etc.)
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation
   - **Status**: Current state (NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, etc.)

   **Priority Configuration:**
   - **Executive Priority** (0-1): Strategic importance
   - **Individual Priority** (0-1): Personal importance  
   - **Community Priority** (0-1): Peer validation (starts at 0)

   **Advanced Options:**
   - **Contributors**: Assign team members
   - **Metadata**: Custom fields and tags
   - **Estimated Effort**: Time/complexity estimates

### Node Types Reference

GraphDone supports 9 core node types designed for clarity and simplicity:

**Core Types:**
- `DEFAULT` - Generic work item for uncategorized content
- `EPIC` - Large initiative spanning multiple deliverables  
- `MILESTONE` - Key project checkpoint and important deadline
- `OUTCOME` - Expected result or deliverable
- `FEATURE` - New functionality or capability to be developed
- `TASK` - Specific work item to be completed
- `BUG` - Software defect requiring resolution
- `IDEA` - Concept or proposal for future development
- `RESEARCH` - Investigation or analysis work

Each node type has its own visual identity with distinct colors and icons in the interface.

## Step 3: Creating Relationships

### Edge Types and Meanings

GraphDone supports rich relationship modeling with 13 edge types:

**Dependency Relationships:**
- `DEPENDS_ON` - Node requires completion of another
- `BLOCKS` - Node prevents progress on another
- `ENABLES` - Node makes another possible

**Structural Relationships:**
- `IS_PART_OF` - Parent-child hierarchy
- `CONTAINS` - Grouping and composition
- `FOLLOWS` - Sequential ordering

**Operational Relationships:**
- `RELATES_TO` - General association
- `PARALLEL_WITH` - Concurrent execution
- `DUPLICATES` - Same work as another node
- `CONFLICTS_WITH` - Incompatible goals
- `VALIDATES` - One node verifies another
- `REFERENCES` - Citation or dependency reference

### Creating Connections

**Visual Connection:**
1. **Click and hold** on source node
2. **Drag** to target node
3. **Release** to create connection
4. **Select** relationship type from popup
5. **Confirm** to establish edge

**Contextual Connection:**
1. **Right-click** on source node
2. **Select** "Add Relationship"
3. **Choose** target node from list or search
4. **Select** relationship type
5. **Set** optional weight/strength (0-1)

**Relationship Editor:**
- **Access** via node details panel
- **Modify** existing relationships
- **Bulk operations** for multiple connections
- **Relationship validation** prevents cycles

## Step 4: Priority and Positioning

### Understanding the Priority System

GraphDone uses **multi-dimensional priority** that determines node position in 3D spherical space:

**Priority Components:**
- **Executive Priority**: Top-down strategic importance
- **Individual Priority**: Bottom-up personal investment
- **Community Priority**: Peer validation and boosting

**Computed Priority**: Weighted combination determines:
- **Spherical Position**: Distance from center (radius)
- **Resource Allocation**: Closer nodes get more resources
- **Visibility**: Central nodes more prominently displayed

### Priority Manipulation

**Setting Initial Priority:**
- Configure during node creation
- Executive/Individual set by creator
- Community priority starts at 0

**Community Boosting:**
- **Anonymous rating system** prevents bias
- **Click boost button** to increase community priority
- **Boost amount** configurable per organization
- **Cumulative effect** drives nodes toward center

**Dynamic Updates:**
- Priority changes trigger **real-time position updates**
- **Smooth animations** show priority migration
- **Visual feedback** indicates boost received

- Document relationship rationale in descriptions
- Validate dependencies don't create impossible cycles

**Meaningful Priorities:**
- Set executive priorities for strategic alignment
- Encourage individual priority expression
- Let community validation drive resource allocation

### Team Collaboration

**Onboarding:**
- **Graph orientation** for new team members
- **Role clarification** and permissions setup
- **Training** on priority system and boosting
- **Practice sessions** with non-critical graphs

**Maintenance:**
- **Regular graph hygiene** - archive completed work
